1.Libraries used:

  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  from sklearn.linear_model import *
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
  import seaborn as sns
  from scipy import stats
  from scipy.stats import norm, skew
  %matplotlib inline
  
  Numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn for the models
  
 2.Motivation for the project:
  
  Learn more and practice with linear model regularizators, elastic net, lasso, ridge and pass the first Udacity assesment.
  
 3.Files in the repository:
 
  test.csv: The dataset whith the house prices and the rest of features.
  Houses.ipynb: The jupyter notebook where we find the code.
 
 4.Summary of the results of the analysis
  - Most correlated variables with the Sale Price.
  - Elastic Net is the best linear model we could fit to this data.
  - Most important variables in that model, best predictors of the price under this framework.
